Runs wind and PV forecasts for India and saves to database

## Install dependencies (requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))

```
poetry install
```

## Linting and formatting

Lint with:
```
make lint
```

Format code with:
```
make format
```

## Running tests

```
make test
```

## Running the app locally
Replace `{DB_URL}` with a postgres DB connection string (see below for setting up a ephemeral local DB)

If testing on a local DB, you may use the following script to seed the the DB with a dummy user, site and site_group. 
```
DB_URL={DB_URL} poetry run seeder
```
⚠️ Note this is a destructive script and will drop all tables before recreating them to ensure a clean slate. DO NOT RUN IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS

This example runs the application and writes the results to stdout
```
DB_URL={DB_URL} NWP_ZARR_PATH=./nwp.zarr poetry run app
```

### Starting a local database using docker

```bash
    docker run \
        -it --rm \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
        -p 54545:5432 postgres:14-alpine \
        postgres
```

The corresponding `DB_URL` will be

`postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54545/postgres`

## Building and running in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Build the Docker image
```
make docker.build
```

Create a container from the image. This example runs the application and writes the results to stdout.\
Replace `{DB_URL}` with a postgres DB connection string.\
*N.B if the database host is `localhost` on the host machine, replace `localhost` with `host.docker.internal` so that docker can access the database from within the container*
```
docker run -it --rm -e DB_URL=${DB_URL} -e NWP_ZARR_PATH=./nwp.zarr -p 5433:5433 ocf/india-forecast-app
```
